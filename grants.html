            Each year Chelsie’s mom and Friends put on a very large fundraiser in Chelsea’s name and those funds are sent too rare
            to help families from all over.<br>
            These funds will go to families that have the same condition as Chelsie in our get out and move program and the rare
            give back.<br>
            Programs like that assist special-needs families obtain special equipment or special things throughout the year and we
            couldn’t do without these kinds of programs.<br>
            It is an honor that Ashleigh and her friends/family have chosen to continue helping and blessing other families through
            Chelsie’s name.<br>

            Most important though Chelsie was a beautiful soul that we want to celebrate all the time and every day.
            <br>
            She’s a reminder that Schizencephaly is unpredictable and unfair and how quickly it can change everything.

            We miss you so much Chelsie!

          Dexter a sweet happy kid that loved his dog and his momma awas born with bilateral Schizencephaly.
          Regardless of the seizures he endured regularly he had a smile no matter what except in physical therapy where Dexter
          was not a fan.          
          Dexter fell asleep and likely passed away from SUDEP, a common underlying condition of uncontrollable seizures in
          refractory epilepsy.          
          What Is Refractory Epilepsy? If your doctor says you have refractory epilepsy, it means that medicine isn’t bringing
          your seizures under control. You might hear the condition called by some other names, such as uncontrolled,intractable,
          or drug-resistant epilepsy.

          Dexter’sfamily has continued his legacy through a Charity Run yearly and donate funds to We are rare to distribute to
          families in need.
          Dexter as a reminder of Schizencephaly and it’s unpredictable nature, how quickly things change and how we have to
          embrace every day and every moment.
          Dexter’s smile will live on through the hearts of many children that he touches in the next coming years through his
          memory and help to other children with Schizencephaly.
